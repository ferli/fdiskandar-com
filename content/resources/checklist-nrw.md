## Checklist Pengurangan Air Hilang (NRW)

Saya membuat checklist ini berdasarkan puluhan NRW reduction program yang saya dampingi. Checklist ini membantu menstruktur perjalanan dari "we have a big NRW problem" menjadi "here's systematic plan untuk fix it."

Checklist ini dirancang untuk membantu utilitas air dalam conducting assessment NRW dan merencanakan reduction program secara sistematis. Gunakan untuk identify gap, prioritize action, dan track progress implementasi. Setiap bagian memiliki detailed checklist dan "target state" untuk guidance—gunakan sesuai dengan konteks organisasi Anda, dan involve external expert ketika dibutuhkan untuk technical assessment.

## PART A: NRW Baseline Assessment

### A1. NRW Calculation & Measurement

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Define NRW calculation methodology (metered vs estimate, peak vs average)
- [ ] Collect production volume data (last 12 months, monthly basis)
- [ ] Collect billed consumption data (customer meters, last 12 months)
- [ ] Calculate water balance (produced - billed - unbilled authorized = NRW)
- [ ] Calculate NRW percentage (NRW / production × 100%)
- [ ] Identify data quality issue (missing data, inconsistent measurement)
- [ ] Establish baseline year (for tracking progress)

**Target state:**
- Accurate NRW calculation dengan <5% estimation error
- Monthly tracking (not annual only)
- Confidence tentang baseline number

**Tools:**
- Water balance spreadsheet (dari water utilities association atau utilitas air peer)
- Production meter calibration certificate
- Billing system data extract

### A2. NRW Breakdown: Physical vs Commercial Loss

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Separate physical loss (kebocoran) dari commercial loss
- [ ] Conduct leak survey (pilot area atau representative sample)
- [ ] Estimate physical loss berdasarkan survey result (scale ke full system)
- [ ] Analyze meter functioning (test sample meter untuk accuracy)
- [ ] Identify illegal connections (visual survey, customer verification)
- [ ] Estimate commercial loss (meter inaccuracy + illegal + reading error + billing inefficiency)
- [ ] Create breakdown summary (physical loss %, commercial loss %)

**Target state:**
- Clear understanding tentang mana loss yang paling significant
- Prioritized intervention untuk high-impact area

**Example:**
- Physical loss: 18% (mostly aged pipes, pressure too high)
- Commercial loss: 12% (meter age, illegal connection, meter reading error)
- Total NRW: 30%

## PART B: Leak Detection & Repair

### B1. Active Leakage Detection Program

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Develop leak detection SOP (frequency, methodology, recording)
- [ ] Train field team untuk leak detection (acoustic method, visual signs)
- [ ] Acquire necessary equipment (acoustic leak detector, pressure gauge, etc.)
- [ ] Establish leak database (location, severity, priority)
- [ ] Establish repair prioritization logic (high water loss leak first)
- [ ] Monitor repair completion rate (target: 100% within 30 days)
- [ ] Track impact (reduction in water loss post-repair)

**Frequency recommendation:**
- High-risk area (old pipes, high leakage history): Monthly
- Medium-risk area: Quarterly
- Low-risk area: Semi-annual

**Target state:**
- Regular leak detection program running
- Average leak repair time: <30 days
- No chronic leaks repeat di same location

### B2. Pressure Management

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Map network pressure (measure pressure di various points/zones)
- [ ] Identify high-pressure area (>60 PSI / >4 bar)
- [ ] Install Pressure Reducing Valves (PRV) di high-pressure zone
- [ ] Set PRV to optimal pressure (40-50 PSI / 2.8-3.5 bar, balance adequacy & leakage reduction)
- [ ] Monitor PRV functioning (regular check untuk malfunction)
- [ ] Track water loss reduction post-PRV (should see 5-10% reduction)
- [ ] Expand PRV installation ke additional zone based on pilot result

**Expected outcome:**
- 3-5% water loss reduction through pressure management alone

**Investment:**
- PRV + installation cost: ~Rp 50-100 juta per zone (depending size)
- Quick ROI through water saving

- [ ] Procure replacement meter (ensure quality, certification)
- [ ] Execute replacement program (phased, ~10-20% per year)
- [ ] Train field team untuk proper meter installation & reading
- [ ] Monitor meter replacement progress & water loss impact

**Target state:**
- 100% meter age <10 years (maintain through ongoing replacement)
- Meter accuracy >95% (calibration check)
- Zero non-functioning meter

**Investment:**
- Meter cost: ~Rp 300k-800k per meter (depending size)

- [ ] Use technology (mobile app untuk meter reading, real-time validation)
- [ ] Monitor billing accuracy (audit bill vs meter reading matching)
- [ ] Investigate anomaly (consumption spike, sudden drop)
- [ ] Establish dispute resolution process (customer can dispute reading)

**Target state:**
- Meter reading accuracy >98%
- Zero systematic bias
- Fast dispute resolution

### C3. Illegal Connection Detection & Enforcement

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Conduct survey untuk identify illegal connection (no meter, tap outside formal connection)
- [ ] Develop enforcement process (approach customer, offer legalization, set deadline)
- [ ] Encourage legalization (offer incentive: low connection fee, installment plan)
- [ ] Monitor compliance (follow-up untuk non-responsive customer)
- [ ] Document enforcement action (for audit trail & learning)
- [ ] Re-survey periodically (ensure illegal connection not re-appear)
- [ ] Track revenue recovery (additional meter revenue from legalization)

**Target state:**
- <1% illegal connection in service area
- Quick response to newly discovered illegal connection

## Development Commands

### Prerequisites
- Hugo v0.152.2 extended (auto-installed by Cloudflare Pages)
- Git (for version control)
- Text editor (for markdown content)

### Local Development

**Start development server:**
```bash
cd /c/Repo/fdiskandar-com
hugo server -D
# Output: Web Server is available at http://localhost:56146/ (or available port)
# Auto-rebuilds when content changes
```

**Build static site:**
```bash
hugo --quiet
# Generates /public/ folder with compiled HTML/CSS/assets
```

**Build for production (with minification):**
```bash
hugo --minify
```

**Check for broken links/resources:**
```bash
grep -r "href=" content/ | grep -v "http"
```

### Content Management

**Add new page:**
1. Create new markdown file in appropriate content directory
2. Add frontmatter: `title`, `description`, `date` (if applicable)
3. Run `hugo server -D` to preview
4. Content auto-publishes when committed to main branch

**Markdown frontmatter template:**
```yaml
---
title: "Page Title Here"
description: "Brief description for meta tags and listing"
date: 2025-12-22
draft: false
---
```

### Git Workflow

**Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
git push origin main
```

**Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys on push to main branch**
- Build process: Clone repo → Run `hugo` → Deploy to CDN
- Build status visible in Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → Deployments

## Architecture & Content Strategy

### Site Structure

**Navigation Structure (5 main sections):**
1. **Tentang (About)** - Personal background and philosophy
2. **Keahlian (Expertise)** - 4 core competency areas with detailed explanations
3. **Analisis & Wawasan (Insights)** - Industry trends, benchmarks, regulatory landscape
4. **Pemikiran Strategis (Essays)** - Longer-form strategic thinking pieces
5. **Resources & Panduan (Resources)** - Practical frameworks, checklists, implementation guides

### Content Guidelines

**Tone & Voice:**
- Personal brand (use "saya" / "I" consistently)
- Professional but conversational
- Based on real 30+ years of experience
- Avoid generic consultant-speak
- Include specific stories and lessons learned

**Content Types:**

1. **Main Pages** (about.md, contact.md)
   - Personal narrative and philosophy
   - Professional background with anecdotes
   - Clear value proposition

2. **Expertise Pages** (5 files)
   - Problem statement + solution approach
   - Open with personal experience/perspective
   - Multi-stakeholder perspective (for different audience types)
   - Actionable insights

3. **Insight Articles** (4 files)
   - Data-driven analysis
   - Current industry trends and data
   - Personal perspective on findings
   - Typically 2000-3000 words

4. **Essay/Strategic Thinking** (3 files)
   - Longer-form (3000-4000 words)
   - Reflective, principle-based
   - "Here's what I've learned" approach
   - Future-focused scenarios

5. **Resources** (3 files)
   - Practical: frameworks, checklists, templates
   - Implementation-focused
   - Step-by-step guidance
   - Personal context on why resource was created

### Personal Brand Voice

When editing content, maintain these characteristics:
- **First person:** "Saya telah..." not "FD Iskandar telah..."
- **Storytelling:** Include mini-stories and real examples
- **Specificity:** "50+ PDAM" not "berbagai organisasi"
- **Conversational:** Like talking to a peer, not a sales pitch
- **Authentic:** Acknowledge what didn't work, not just successes

## Hugo Configuration

**Key settings in hugo.toml:**

```toml
baseURL = "https://fdiskandar.com/"
languageCode = "id"
theme = "PaperMod"
title = "FD Iskandar | Strategic Technologist"
```

**Menu items configured in hugo.toml** - update here if navigation changes

**Build output: /public/** - not committed to git, generated by Hugo

## Deployment Pipeline

**Automatic (recommended):**
1. Edit content locally
2. `git push` to main branch on GitHub
3. Cloudflare Pages detects push
4. Auto-runs `hugo` build
5. Deploys to fdiskandar.com within 1-2 minutes
6. View build status: Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → fdiskandar-com → Deployments

**Critical fix applied:** `.gitignore` changed from `resources/` to `resources/_gen/` to ensure `content/resources/` folder is tracked by git and deployed.

## Common Development Tasks

### Updating homepage content
- Edit: `content/_index.md`
- Hugo rebuilds immediately in dev server
- Push to main for live deployment

### Adding new expertise area
- Create: `content/expertise/new-topic.md`
- Add menu item in `hugo.toml` (if adding main section)
- Add to `content/expertise/_index.md` introduction

### Publishing new insight article
- Create: `content/insights/article-slug.md`
- Include date and description frontmatter
- Links auto-appear on insights listing page

### Creating new resource/framework
- Create: `content/resources/resource-name.md`
- Keep practical focus
- Include step-by-step guide or template

## Potential Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Resources pages show 404 after deploy**
- Cause: `content/resources/` folder being gitignored
- Solution: Check `.gitignore` has `resources/_gen/` not `resources/`
- Verify: `git ls-files content/resources/` shows tracked files

**Issue: Changes not appearing after git push**
- Check: Cloudflare Pages deployments tab for build errors
- Solution: Review build log, fix errors, push again
- Note: Cloudflare caches - may need to clear cache in Cloudflare dashboard

**Issue: Local server shows different content than live site**
- Solution: Run `hugo --minify` locally to match production build
- Cache issue: Clear browser cache or check Cloudflare cache settings

## Content Performance Notes

**Current metrics:**
- 33 total pages being built
- Build time: ~79ms (Hugo is very fast)
- No database, no external API calls
- Static site = instant load times globally via Cloudflare CDN

## Adding Team Members

When new contributors join:
1. Add to GitHub repository (requires push access)
2. Point them to this CLAUDE.md
3. Show how to run `hugo server -D` locally
4. Explain commit → auto-deploy flow
5. Review content tone before first commits

## Resources for Developers

- Hugo Documentation: https://gohugo.io/documentation/
- PaperMod Theme: https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod
- Markdown Guide: https://www.markdownguide.org/
- Cloudflare Pages: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/

## Notes for Future Claude Sessions

- This is a **personal brand website**, not a product or engineering project
- Focus on **content quality** and **personal voice consistency**
- The audience is primarily C-level executives at water utilities
- Emphasis on **thought leadership** over marketing
- **No major UI/UX changes** - design is intentionally minimal and professional
- Content edits should enhance personal narrative, not remove it

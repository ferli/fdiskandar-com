## Quick Overview

### The Workflow (Simplified)

```
1. DEFINE SCOPE (15 min)
   What's article about? What must it answer? Who reads it?

2. RESEARCH (4-6 hours)
   Find sources, extract findings, synthesize insights

3. COMPILE NOTES (1 hour)
   Organize findings using template structure
   Create reference list

4. CLAUDE CODE WRITE (1-2 hours)
   Outline → Section 1 → Section 2 → ... → Complete draft

5. EDIT & PUBLISH (1-2 hours)
   Final review, citations, rebuild & deploy
```

**Total: 8-11 hours per article**

## How It Works with Claude Code

### Method 1: Research First, Then Write (Recommended)

1. Complete all research (save to `research/insights/[article]-notes.md`)
2. Submit research file to Claude Code: "Read this file and outline article"
3. Review outline, request changes if needed
4. Ask Claude Code to write Section 1 based on research
5. Review Section 1, approve or request revisions
6. Repeat for Sections 2, 3, etc.
7. Ask Claude Code to add Introduction & Conclusion
8. Final edit & publish

**Why this works:**
- Research complete before writing = more coherent article
- Claude Code integrates findings from your research
- Section-by-section review = better quality control
- You maintain ownership & understanding of content

### Method 2: Concurrent Research + Writing

1. Quick scope definition (30 min)
2. Initial research (2 hours)
3. Ask Claude Code to outline article & suggest research gaps
4. Deepen research focused on gap areas (3-4 hours)
5. Write final article with Claude Code using complete research

**Why this works:**
- Writing clarifies what you need to know
- Outline guidance focuses research efforts
- Learn & refine understanding as you go

### Method 3: Iterative (Section by Section)

1. Research Section 1 topic (1-2 hours)
2. Write Section 1 with Claude Code (1 hour)
3. Review draft → identify what else you need to know
4. Research Section 2 topic (1-2 hours)
5. Write Section 2 with Claude Code (1 hour)
6. Repeat for remaining sections

**Why this works:**
- Most natural iteration cycle
- Each section can stand alone
- Continuous refinement of understanding

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Thorough Research
- Spend 4-6 hours per article
- Use 5-10+ diverse sources
- Extract actual findings, not just summaries
- Synthesize original insights

**Result:** Claude Code has real material to work with

### 2. Structured Research Notes
- Use consistent template format
- Organize by theme or source
- Include synthesis section (original analysis)
- Create complete reference list

**Result:** Claude Code can easily integrate research into article

### 3. Clear Direction
- Define key questions article must answer
- Describe target audience explicitly
- Request outline before full writing
- Review & approve structure before content

**Result:** Article stays focused & coherent

### 4. Iterative Review
- Don't expect perfect first draft
- Review section-by-section, not whole article at once
- Provide specific feedback ("Section 2 needs more data on X")
- Allow Claude Code to iterate based on feedback

**Result:** Quality improves through iteration

### 5. Rigorous Citations
- Every claim supported by research
- Consistent citation format throughout
- Complete reference list at end
- Track sources as you research

**Result:** Article credible & trustworthy

## Timeline & Effort Estimate

### Per Article
- **Scope definition:** 0.5 hours
- **Deep research:** 4-6 hours
- **Compile notes:** 0.5-1 hour
- **Claude Code integration:** 1-2 hours
- **Edit & publish:** 1-2 hours
- **Total:** 8-11 hours per article

- **Total effort:** 24-33 hours
- **Realistic timeline:** 1.5-2 weeks (if 3-4 hours per day)
- **Result:** 3 professional, research-backed articles (7,500-9,000 words combined)

### 5 Resources + 2 Pemikiran Articles (Later)
- **Total effort:** 56-77 hours additional
- **Realistic timeline:** 4-6 weeks (if 3-4 hours per day)
- **Result:** 7 professional articles + frameworks/tools

## Getting Started

### Option A: Start with Research (If Time Available)

1. Read `QUICK_START_RESEARCH.md` (15 min)
2. Pick first article ("Benchmark Kinerja PDAM" recommended)
3. Define scope (use template from QUICK_START)
4. Start research (4-6 hours)
5. Save findings to research notes template
6. When research complete, submit to Claude Code

### Option B: Start with Guidance (If Unsure)

1. Read `QUICK_START_RESEARCH.md` (15 min)
2. Read `CLAUDE_CODE_RESEARCH_INTEGRATION.md` (30 min)
3. Pick integration method (Sequential recommended for first article)
4. Begin research using tips in QUICK_START
5. Engage Claude Code when research ~50% complete for outline guidance

### Option C: Learn by Doing (If Prefer Hands-On)

1. Read `QUICK_START_RESEARCH.md` (15 min)
2. Pick article & define scope (30 min)
3. Start research, gather 3-4 sources
4. Compile preliminary notes to research template
5. Submit preliminary notes to Claude Code: "What should I research more?"
6. Use Claude Code feedback to guide remaining research
7. Complete research notes, submit for article writing

## Research Folder Setup

Already created:
```
research/
├── README.md (guide)
├── template.md (copy this for each article)
├── insights/
├── resources/
└── pemikiran/
```

To start new article research:
```bash
# Copy template
cp research/template.md research/insights/[article-title]-notes.md

# Edit in your preferred editor
# Fill in scope, key questions, evidence needed
# Begin research & compile findings
```

## Quality Standards for Articles

Research-backed articles should:

- [ ] Have 5-10+ diverse sources (government, academic, industry, case studies)
- [ ] Answer 4-5 key research questions
- [ ] Include original synthesis (not just summarize sources)
- [ ] Cite sources properly & consistently throughout
- [ ] Acknowledge limitations & gaps in research
- [ ] Be 2,000-3,500 words (substantive, not surface)
- [ ] Include complete reference list
- [ ] Use simple, clear language (accessible to intelligent non-specialist)
- [ ] Provide actionable insights or implications

**Articles meeting these standards** will position you as credible thought leader, not shallow commentator.

## Common Questions

**Q: How much research is "enough"?**
A: For 8-10 hour article: 4-6 hours research minimum (50% of effort). Better to research deeply & write quickly than research shallow & write long.

**Q: What if I don't find all sources easily?**
A: That's normal. Start with what you find (government, PERPAMSI, major publications), then ask Claude Code "Based on this research, what else would strengthen this section?" That guides additional research.

**Q: Do I need to understand everything deeply before writing?**
A: No. Research 80%, then write. Writing clarifies what you still need to understand. You can deepen research in specific areas based on what draft reveals.

**Q: Can I use web search in Claude Code instead of pre-researching?**
A: Yes, partially. Claude Code can do web searches. But pre-researching gives you better context & control over quality/depth. Hybrid approach: Pre-research 80%, use Claude Code web search for specific gaps.

**Q: How do I make sure Claude Code uses my research accurately?**
A: Review each section. You did the research—verify Claude Code represents it correctly. Think of Claude Code as "writing assistant" not "truth maker."

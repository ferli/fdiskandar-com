## 3. Non-Revenue Water Reduction (Pengurangan Air Hilang)

### 3.1 Understanding NRW

**Definition:**
- Water that is produced but does not generate revenue
- Includes physical losses (kebocoran/leaks) and commercial losses (billing issues)
- Calculated as: NRW % = (Production - Billed Water) / Production × 100%

**Typical Indonesian PDAM Situation:**
- Average NRW: 30-40%
- Physical loss (kebocoran): 15-25%
- Commercial loss: 5-15%
- For 100 million m³ production per year with 35% NRW = 35 million m³ lost

**Financial Impact Example:**
- PDAM revenue: Rp 500 billion per year
- With 35% NRW = potential loss: Rp 175 billion per year
- Typical reduction target: 5-10% over 3 years
- Financial benefit: Rp 25-50 billion additional annual revenue

**Operational Impact:**
- Higher treatment costs (chemicals, energy) for "wasted" water
- Unsustainable extraction from limited water sources
- Customer dissatisfaction due to frequent outages
- Difficulty meeting expanding service targets

### 3.2 Physical Loss Analysis

**Root Causes:**

1. **Infrastructure Aging**
   - Pipes over 20 years old: corrosion, brittleness, micro-cracks
   - Lack of replacement budget: deferred maintenance
   - Poor installation practices: joints, connections
   - Soil conditions: corrosive soil accelerates pipe deterioration

2. **Pressure Management Issues**
   - Excessive system pressure (>80 psi): stress on pipes, increased leaks
   - Pressure fluctuations: daily variation causing pipe stress
   - No pressure control in zones: uniform high pressure everywhere
   - Night flow surges: temporary pressure spikes from operational changes

3. **Maintenance Approach**
   - Reactive only: repair when reported, not preventive
   - Lack of systematic monitoring: small leaks undetected for months
   - Limited leak detection capability: acoustic listening, visual inspection
   - Slow repair response: weeks between detection and repair

4. **Detection Challenges**
   - Small leaks hard to spot: meters of underground pipe
   - Multiple pipe materials: different failure modes
   - Urban areas harder: noise, digging restrictions, traffic
   - Rural areas harder: sparse population, low pressure, slow detection

### 3.3 Commercial Loss Analysis

**Root Causes:**

1. **Meter Inaccuracy**
   - Aging meters: >10 years old underregister (read less than actual)
   - Meter maintenance: calibration drift, mechanical wear
   - Wrong size meters: capacity mismatch for actual consumption
   - Installation issues: water bypass, improper connections

2. **Illegal/Unmetered Connections**
   - Informal connections: bypassing meter system, temporary pipes
   - Meter tampering: deliberate bypass or obstruction
   - Data entry errors: reading recorded wrong, billing not updated
   - System gaps: connections exist but not in billing system

3. **Billing System Issues**
   - Disconnection enforcement: inconsistent for non-payment
   - Read gaps: missed meter readings, estimated billing
   - Data quality: duplicate accounts, merge errors
   - Process delays: long time between reading and billing

4. **Customer Behavior**
   - Non-payment: deliberate or inability to pay
   - Meter avoidance: seeking to avoid metering
   - Negotiation: customers contesting bills
   - Default: customers cease using service without notice

### 3.4 Integrated Reduction Strategy

   - Major security investments and approvals
   - Incident escalation for significant breaches

2. **Security Organization**
   - Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or equivalent role

3. **Security Standards & Policies**
   - Information security policy (classification, handling, disposal)
   - Access control policy (user provisioning, password, privilege)
   - Incident response policy (detection, investigation, notification)
   - Vendor security policy (assessment, contracting, monitoring)

### 4.2 SCADA Security

**Unique Challenges:**
- SCADA systems controlling critical water distribution
- Real-time responsiveness required (security cannot slow operations)
- Older equipment with no security features
- Network isolation difficult in modern integrated systems
- High consequence of failure (water outages affect public)

**Security Approach:**

1. **Network Segmentation**
   - Separate SCADA network from business IT network
   - Firewalls and access controls between segments
   - Bastion hosts for necessary cross-segment communication
   - Regular segmentation testing

2. **Access Control**
   - Strong authentication (multi-factor preferred)
   - Principle of least privilege (minimum necessary access)
   - Audit logging of all SCADA system access and changes
   - Segregation of duties (change approval separate from implementation)

3. **Monitoring & Detection**
   - Anomaly detection for unusual SCADA commands
   - IDS/IPS for network-level threats
   - Integrity checking for critical configuration files
   - Real-time alerting for suspicious activities

4. **Incident Response**
   - SCADA-specific incident response procedures
   - Manual operation procedures for critical systems
   - Backup controls in case of system failure
   - Regular drills and tabletop exercises

### 4.3 Data Protection

**Customer Data Protection:**
- Personal data: names, addresses, phone numbers, ID numbers
- Usage data: consumption patterns, payment history
- Financial data: bank accounts, payment methods
- Compliance: PDP requirements, BSSN guidelines

**Protection Measures:**
- Data encryption (in transit with TLS, at rest with AES)
- Access controls (role-based, authentication)
- Data minimization (collect only necessary data)
- Retention policies (delete when no longer needed)
- Audit logging (who accessed what and when)

**Breach Response:**
- Detection: automated alerting for unusual access patterns
- Containment: isolate affected systems, prevent further access
- Investigation: determine scope, cause, impact
- Notification: inform affected customers and regulator (required under PDP)
- Remediation: patch vulnerability, improve controls

### 4.4 Compliance & Risk Management

**Risk Assessment Process:**
1. Asset identification (systems, data, people, facilities)
2. Threat identification (external attacks, insider threats, accidents)
3. Vulnerability assessment (known security weaknesses)
4. Risk calculation (threat × vulnerability × impact)
5. Mitigation planning (address high-risk items)

**Common Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Prevention:** Reduce vulnerability (patches, better design)
- **Detection:** Identify threats quickly (monitoring, logging)
- **Response:** Limit impact (incident response, backup systems)
- **Acceptance:** Tolerate risk if impact acceptable

**Compliance Verification:**
- Annual security audit (internal or external)
- Quarterly compliance dashboard to board
- Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing (annual)
- Configuration management (change tracking, standards compliance)

## 7. Frequently Asked Contexts

### When discussing transformation timelines
- Typical 3-year transformation: assessment (6mo) → implementation (18mo) → optimization (9mo)
- Quick wins in first 3-6 months boost morale and ROI
- Core transformation 18+ months as systems, data, processes change
- Sustainability phase ongoing—no true "end"

### When discussing budget allocation
- Typical split: Hardware/Software (40%) + Implementation Services (35%) + Training/Change (15%) + Contingency (10%)
- Total cost of ownership includes: license, implementation, training, ongoing support, upgrades
- Early budget allocation for change management critical to success
- Hidden costs: staff time, downtime during migration, overtime

### When discussing team capability
- Most PDAM IT teams optimized for "keep the lights on" (maintenance)
- Transformation requires different skills: architecture, change management, project delivery
- Plan for external support (systems integrator) for 18-30 months
- Use transformation period to develop in-house capabilities
- Retain external expertise for ongoing optimization

### When discussing vendor selection
- Avoid "best of breed" (6+ systems)—integration nightmare
- Prefer integrated platforms (ERP + BI + CRM)
- Consider total cost, not just license cost
- Strong implementation partner as important as product choice
- Reference checks with similar-sized PDAM essential

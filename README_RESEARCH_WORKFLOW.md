## 🎓 Learning Path

**If new to this process:**
1. QUICK_START_RESEARCH.md (learn basics)
2. RESEARCH_WORKFLOW_VISUAL.md (see the workflow)
3. Start first article research
4. CLAUDE_CODE_RESEARCH_INTEGRATION.md (when ready to write)

**If returning to second/third article:**
1. Quick review of QUICK_START_RESEARCH.md
2. Copy template.md to new research file
3. Conduct research (familiar now)
4. Use same Claude Code method from first article

**If troubleshooting:**
1. RESEARCH_WORKFLOW.md (detailed reference)
2. CLAUDE_CODE_RESEARCH_INTEGRATION.md (Claude Code-specific)
3. RESEARCH_ARTICLE_CHECKLIST.md (track what's missing)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Research is 50% of effort** — Invest time in good research. Claude Code can write well if you give it solid material.

2. **Use template consistently** — Every article uses same template. Consistency helps Claude Code integrate better.

3. **Synthesis > Summary** — Don't just summarize sources. Combine findings to create original insights.

4. **Section-by-section review** — Don't review entire article at once. Review sections as Claude Code writes them.

5. **Save research for updates** — Research notes become basis for future article updates. Archive them.

6. **Build research discipline** — Start small (1 article), build consistency, then scale up.

7. **Quality over speed** — 8-11 hours for one great article > 4 hours for shallow articles.
